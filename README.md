# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Computer Science
- I am taking STATS 220 because Its one of the few science courses outside of my major that seemed somewhat interesting.
- I am interested in learning about statistics prefferably. Other topics are optional.
